# Changelog

## 2026-09-04 — published
Published: README, LICENSE, ROLLOUT and SOURCES rewritten for a public reader; the standard itself unchanged.

## 2026-08-23 — fleet-level check (tooling only; the standard is unchanged and VERSION is not bumped)
`scripts/fleet-versions.sh` compares every project's vendored `docs/STANDARDS.md` against the canonical clone — the one comparison no project gate can make, since each project's drift test only checks its copy against its own header. Reports ok / MISSING / UNREADABLE / BADHEADER / DRIFTED / DIVERGED / STALE / VERSION / NOLINK / BADLINK; a project with no vendored copy, or a run that checks zero projects, is a failure rather than a pass. Prints the canonical HEAD it measured against. ROLLOUT.md step 5.

## 2026-08-23 — first adopted version
36 rules in four groups (Code C1–C13, Tests T1–T8, Security & privacy S1–S6, Workflow W1–W9), derived from what the nine projects already practised; nine cross-project conflicts resolved (SOURCES.md); proposals P1 (dependency audit in the gate) and P3 (three facts in every project header) adopted, P2 deferred to the next browser-gate touch per project, P4/P5 kept as notes. Rollout one project at a time; see ROLLOUT.md for the mechanism. Adopted by Ghie.
